        <p>This web page is a short description of a few hobbies I'm into and a little about myself. See if I can't
        teach you a few things about some of the things that excite me! I am someone who always likes to learn. Not only in an academic setting : I like learning
        about cooking, music, electronics, and many more aspects of life. This webpage is a mix of fun facts about a few things related to my hobbies and how I
        got into these things. I hope you will enjoy this website as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>

        <p>If you don't know where to go first, check out the <a href="programming.html">programming page</a>! This website was made completely
        using the knowledge I acquired in <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">Harvard's CS50 online course</a>!</p>
