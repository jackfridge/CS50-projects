        <h3>Start small!</h3>
        <p>Cooking is a vast subject and most people I know who don't like it say it "takes too long".</p>
        <p>Obviously, cooking a turkey dinner every day would be very boring quickly, so the trick is to find a few simple
        recipes that are fast and easy! Start with one dish with very few ingredients. Most of the time, simple recipes are
        the best to start with since you don't feel overwhelmed and can be proud of your dish at the end. Picking difficult
        recipes early on will only leave you feeling like it's too hard or too difficult, so stick to simple!</p>

        <b>Try making a pasta dish!</b>
        <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/macaroni-cheese-16645937.jpg" alt="Mac & Cheese" width="400" height="300" style="float:right">
        <p>Why pasta? Because it's simple, but can be so delicious. Forget boxed mac & cheese, frozen TV dinners and the like.
        Try making your own mac & cheese with pasta, your favorite cheese, milk, flour and butter. That's it! There is no high heat
        cooking or fear of burning your food, and you get to inject a little creativity by picking which cheese you want! Don't
        go for american cheese, go out and buy a small block of cheese and grate it yourself! Enjoy the process of making something
        with your own hands and creating something our of no more than a few simple ingredients.</p>
        <p>The internet is a big place, but you can just Google mac & cheese recipe and thousands of great recipes will show up.
        Avoid recipes with 5-6 spices, or with ingredients that cost an arm and a leg. Stick to simple! In my experience, simple
        recipes don't feel so simple after a bit. There is no perfect in cooking, so don't feel like Gordon Ramsay is going
        to taste your food and critique it, you're your own critic, so give yourself a break!</p>

        <p>The most important thing in cooking is to not stress about it. Don't have cheddar? Use mozarella or parmesan!
        Adjust and modify recipes as you go and find what works for you! You can very easily cook the same recipe 10 times,
        changing only one thing and it may taste completely different! Try undercooking the pasta by 1-2 minutes. Don't like it?
        Increase the cook time next time, and have fun!</p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
