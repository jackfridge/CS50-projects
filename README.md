# CS50-projects

Here is an archive of my CS50 projects.
The first 5 weeks of CS50 are primarily in C, so I learned my fundamentals of coding and algorithms in C.
This evolved into higher level programming like Python and Javascript as well as markup languages like HTML/CSS for web development.
My web programming experience was primarily with Flask framrwork.

In certain C programs, a library caled cs50.h is included. This training-wheel library was intended to help us get off our feet when starting programming, as to focus on the more important concepts, such as algorithm logic or learning the syntax of a language.

## Week 1 projects:  
**Hello:** Obligatory hello world, my first program written in C.  
**Cash:** This simple command-line program asks user for an amount of money and outputs the minimum number of coins needed to get that cash in all coins.  
**Credit:** This program tests if a credit card number is valid or not using the appropriate algorithms. While these early codes are very dirty and unefficient, I think looking back on where I start will be very important to keep improving and revisiting old programs in order to improve them as fun exercises in the future.  
**Mario:** A simple command-line program that takes an integer (1 - 8) as input and outputs a mario-style pyramid of blocks as hash (#) symbols.  
**Population:** User inputs a starting population and an end (target) population. At certain pre-determined birth and death rates, the program will output the number of years needed to reach the target population.
